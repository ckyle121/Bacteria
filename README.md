# Bacteria

Using my knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, I have created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage, and a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage. Additionally, when the webpage loads, the bar and bubble chart are working according to the requirements in Deliverable 1 and 2, respectively, and the gauge chart is working according to the requirements listed for this Deliverable.

Take a look at my website on GitHub Pages:
